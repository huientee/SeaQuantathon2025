🌊 SeaQuantathon 2025

This project was developed for SEA Quantathon 2025, a regional innovation challenge focused on applying quantum and quantitative methods to solve pressing climate and sustainability issues.

🌐 Project Overview

This solution leverages Quantum Reservoir Computing to forecast sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and the onset of marine heatwaves (MHWs) in the South China Sea. By utilizing advanced quantum algorithms, the model delivers higher forecasting accuracy than conventional approaches.

🎯 Objective

To design and implement a robust quantum-enhanced forecasting system that:

- Accurately predicts marine heatwave events 

- Supports early-warning systems for ecosystem conservation and fisheries management

- Enables policy-makers and coastal industries to make informed, proactive decisions

- Addresses the increasing risk of extreme climate events due to rising ocean temperatures

🌱 Why It Matters

- Marine heatwaves contribute to:

- Coral bleaching and biodiversity loss

- Disruption of fisheries and aquaculture

- Economic threats to tourism and coastal livelihoods

- Amplified typhoon activity and extreme weather

By integrating quantum computing into marine heatwave forecasting, this project aims to pave the way for next-generation climate resilience tools in Southeast Asia and beyond.
